        <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong> Marinate the chicken (optional) </strong><br>
                In a bowl, combine the chicken cubes with 1 tablespoon of yogurt, a pinch of salt, and 1 teaspoon of garam masala. Let it marinate for about 20-30 minutes (or even overnight in the fridge if you have time).</li>
            <li><strong>Cook the chicken</strong><br>Heat 1 tablespoon of butter in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add the marinated chicken pieces and cook until they are lightly browned and cooked through, about 7-8 minutes. Remove the chicken from the pan and set aside.</li>
            <li><Strong>Make the sauce:</Strong><br>
            <ul>
                <li>In the same pan, add another tablespoon of butter. Once melted, add the chopped onion and cook until soft and golden, about 5 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>Add the minced garlic and ginger, and cook for 1 more minute until fragrant.</li>
                <li>Stir in the crushed tomatoes, garam masala, cumin, chili powder, turmeric, coriander powder, and salt. Cook for about 5-7 minutes, allowing the flavors to combine and the sauce to thicken.</li>
            </ul></li>
            <li><strong>Add Cream:</strong><br>
                Lower the heat and stir in the heavy cream and yogurt (if using). Mix well, and let the sauce simmer for 5-6 minutes, allowing it to become creamy and rich.</li>
            <li><strong>Combine the chicken and the sauce</strong><br>
                Add the cooked chicken back into the sauce and simmer for another 5 minutes, allowing the chicken to absorb the sauce and become tender.</li>
            <li><strong>Garnish and serve</strong><br>
                Garnish with fresh cilantro. Serve your butter chicken with steamed rice or naan bread.</li>
